# Kiro CLI Output Configuration

> **Note:** This file is automatically regenerated by `telegram_bot.py` on

> in your `.env` file and restart the bot.

## File Output Location

When saving files, outputs, reports, code, or any other generated content,
**always save them to the configured output directory** shown below.

**Output Directory:** *(set by KIRO_OUTPUT_DIR — see .env)*

## Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase filenames with hyphens as word separators (e.g., `my-report.html`)
- Include a date suffix for time-sensitive outputs (e.g., `summary-2024-01-15.md`)
- Use the appropriate file extension for the content type

## Guidelines

- Save all generated HTML, Markdown, JSON, CSV, and other output files to the
  output directory above.
- Create subdirectories within the output directory when organising related files
  (e.g., `images/`, `data/`, `reports/`).
- Do **not** save temporary or intermediate working files to the output directory.
- After completing a task, confirm which files were saved and their filenames so
  the bot can report the correct URLs.
